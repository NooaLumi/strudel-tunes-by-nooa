# Strudel tunes by Nooa

This is a repository of tunes I've made using **Strudel**. I'm new to Strudel and have no real background in music production, so if you see something that doesn't make sense to you, it probably made no sense to me neither. Reference at your own peril. 

I've attached an MIT license to this repository so you're free to use the code as you see fit, but be mindful that many of these are remixes of existing songs, which remain intellectual property of their respective owners. You can find more information in the header comments of each file. 

## How to run

You can use the online REPL at [strudel.cc](https://strudel.cc) and copy-paste the code there or install Strudel locally from its [repository](https://codeberg.org/uzu/strudel).
